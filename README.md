# Web-Scraping

FOLDER: Python code scraping

SCRAPING VIVONO.COM 
- The site is browsed through “Infinite scroll”, why I decided to go with selenium. However, the site could maximum load 2025 items, if all features (price range, reviews, and countries) were selected (more than 16000 items). This forced my to break each scrape down to less than 2025 items in order to scrape the site due to the limitation regarding loading of items.

The py file “A_infinite script” contain my “main code” for scraping Vivino.com.


FOLDER: Rcodes
Contains the following two files.
Wines.R : Contains the data manipulation, exploration and various test.
WineGraphs: Contains the graph and test, I ended up using for my presentation and blog.
